After loading and exploring the main dataset, I scrape and process gas prices. The notebook then aligns trip data with gas prices based on pickup dates, addressing missing values through a fill strategy. Duplicate rows are removed, and a 'Gas Prices' column is added, representing gasoline prices in cents per gallon for each trip. The goal is to uncover correlations between taxi fares and gasoline prices, shedding light on potential patterns amid fuel cost fluctuations. Motivated by my observation that Uber prices were more affordable in Boston compared to Seattle, with a parallel difference in gas prices, I recognized the significance of considering fuel costs in such analyses.
